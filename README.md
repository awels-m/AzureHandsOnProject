# AzureHandsOnProject
here i will be submitting my project on Azure


# INTRODUCTION
Cloud computing allows users to access powerful compute resources on demand. Microsoft Azure is one of the leading cloud platforms, and this project introduced me to its capabilities through hands on experience with deploying and managing Linux Virtual Machine. 

## PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
To guide me through the process of creating a linux VM on Azure, connecting to it via SSH and exploring basic VM management operations like starting, stopping and resizing the VM using the Azure Portal. 

## OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
1. Undestand the Azure Portal and resources organization.
2. Create and manage a Linux Virtual Machine in Azure.
3. Securely connect to the VM using SSH
4. Perform basic VM lifecycle management tasks.
5. Explore configuration opttions for compute resources. 

## PREREQUISITES
1. A valid Azure Subscription (Free Tier is acceptable)
2. A local SSH client (Linux/macOS terminal or PuTTY for windows)
3. Basic understanding of Linux commands and SSH access. 
4. Estimated Time: 1.5-2hours

## TASK OUTLINE
1. Set up Azure account and access the Azure Portal
2. Create a Resource Group for organizing related resources
3. Deploy a Linux Virtual Machine (Ubuntu or other preferred distro)
4. Configure authentication and networking
5. Connect to the VM using SSH.
6. Explore VM configuration and perform basic management tasks.
